## ü§ñ **AI & MACHINE LEARNING IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Current: Rule-Based AI System**

```typescript
// Frequency Pattern Analysis
const frequencyScore = Math.min(alertsLast24h * 20 + alertsLast7d * 5, 100);

// Time Pattern Risk Assessment
const nightAlerts = alerts.filter((a) => isNightTime(a.timestamp));
const timePatternScore = (nightAlerts.length / totalAlerts) * 100;

// Location Risk Scoring
const riskLocations = await checkHighRiskAreas(userHistory);
const locationRiskScore = calculateLocationRisk(riskLocations);
```
